			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<h4> The Topic: "Surviving College"</h4>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="flow-text col s8">
					<p>When the topic was originally revealed to the class, it felt overwhelming to me. My initial thought was "this is such a broad topic." Surely, there was an endless amount of possibilities for us to explore and we were tasked to narrowing it down to one idea. We took some time and brainstormed ideas. Eventually, we settled on the idea of the difficulty students at the University of Washington faced when attempting to join clubs and keeping track of events.</p>
					<p>It was still a very broad topic, but considering we started at "surviving college," we called it progress.</p>
					<p>This book details the design process behind the initial conception of the idea to the decisions that followed that ultimately produced our solution—<b>My Clubs</b>. My Clubs is an application for the University of Washington to aid students in discovering new clubs and keeping track of events.</p>

			<h4>Meet the team!</h4>
			<div class="flow-text">
				<p>Thrown together by <i>almost</i> random forces, the three of us set off on a quarter-long adventure to design a mobile application for students at the University of Washington.</p>
				<p>This was a unique experience for me working in a team. We worked seamlessly as a team, accomplishing tasks with the bare minimum for communication. Each person took it upon themselves to complete an equal portion of the work. It was one the best group experiences I have had. My main role in our overall project was designing the mockups that were used in our final specification as well as the prototypes that came before it.</p>

			<h1>Initial Ideas & Brainstorming</h1>
			<div class="row">
				<img class="materialboxed col s6" data-caption="40 Ideas" src="img/40_ideas.jpg">
				<div class="flow-text col s6">
					<p>In the beginning, my team chose the idea of creating something for students to find events. I then set out to find a good idea, or so I hoped. 40 ideas later, and I still was not sure if I had thought of THE idea. Some ideas I knew were really bad, and the rest I deemed merely bad.</p>
					<p>After discussing with my team, we knew that we wanted to stay away from physical mediums (such as posters, fliers, or help booths). Our main focus was finding a medium that allowed a great deal of flexibility since we wanted to encompass numerous details we felt were important. Some of the original ideas we had included a way for officers of a club to communicate and organize events. We also played around with the idea of incorporating a method for members to have more effect and power on club meetings and events, such as time and location. Understanding the basis of our idea, we narrowed down three ideas (that we deemed had potential) from 100+.</p>

			<h1>Iterating Ideas</h1>
			<h4>Doing too much</h4>  	
			<div class="row">
				<div class="flow-text col s8">
					<p >After narrowing it down to three ideas, each of my team members took one idea and designed a paper prototype. I was tasked with creating a prototype for a Facebook application. This was picked as one of the ideas because many students already used Facebook to keep track of events. The goal of my prototype was to help students keep the events more organized without being cumbersome to use. We wanted to avoid creating something that students will use once before forgetting about its existence. </p>
					<p>However, things did not go according to my hopeful, naive plans...</p>
					<p>Each group member did user testing for all three of our prototypes. It was evident that we had work to do. Reality crashed upon us with the force similar to that of Atlas burdened by the world (okay, maybe it was not quite that dramatic, but you get the idea).</p>

			<h1>User Testing</h1>
			<h4>Understand the audience</h4>
			<div class="row">				
				<img class="materialboxed col s4" data-caption="One of the many scripts used for our user testing rounds" src="img/script.jpg">
				<div class="flow-text cols8">
					<p>For our user testing, we asked fellow classmates to navigate the three prototypes we had made (a Facebook add-on, a mobile application for the RSO, and an addition to the current MyUW site). We told the users our main idea, and asked them questions along the way. It became apparent that there were navigation issues. One of the most important things I came to understand is how I as a designer created a prototype that I could navigate flawlessly. Attempting to help users navigate prototypes made by my teammates proved difficult since I could not follow their line of thought when creating these prototypes. I envisioned and tried to create my prototype to be as easy and intuitive to navigate as possible, but in actuality that was not the case.</p>
					<p>As a group, we met back up and discussed our findings. The main thing I took away from the user testing that we did was this: we were trying to do too many things, and in doing so we accomplished almost nothing. There were too many conflicting features and issues that our users ran into trying to navigate each prototypes. Some features were not clear, and others were missed entirely. We learned that navigation had to be a huge consideration for us to acknowledge in the future. Each prototype had a few things that the users really enjoyed and seemed effective, but those were paired with a long list of failures. The general consensus was that the overall concept was good, but the execution thus far was lackluster.</p>

			<h1>The DECISION</h1>
			<h4>Narrowing Scope</h4>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="flow-text col s8">
					<p>After our intensive (and eye-opening) user testing, it was finally time to decide on what we wanted to focus on for the final design specification. We knew this was going to be an imperative decision because we needed to stick with it for the rest of the quarter. Deliberation began and none of us felt confident in the future prospects of our current prototypes. Unable to come up with a solid idea, we were stuck. Faced with a conundrum, we took a step back and approached our problem from a differently angle. We discussed what went wrong with our initial ideas, and focused on what went well.</p>
					<p>Understanding that trying to target as much of the student population as possible was holding us back because we were being overambitious helped facilitate us towards the idea we would use. We used this revelation to evaluate a solution in a new light. A new consensus was achieved: less is more. We scrapped all three of our ideas and thought smaller. Literally. Well, at least in screen size: my group decided to design a mobile application.</p>
					<p>The major ideas that we wanted to keep was the idea of allowing Facebook integration. We felt this was important because so many clubs on campus currently have Facebook pages and post events on Facebook. Narrowing our scope, we determined that focusing solely on events was the path to take. The mobile platform was chosen because we believed it would be most convenient considering the fact that almost all of the student population owns a smartphone. We had to leave behind ideas we thought would be useful to incorporate, but it made our overall concept more refined and feel more sophisticated.</p>

				<img class="materialboxed col s3" data-caption="Small changes from Phase 2 to Final Phase" src="img/final.png">
				<div class="flow-text col s9">
					<p>The first iteration of our new idea seemed promising. We knew we still had a lot of kinks to iron out, but we were enthusiastic about the route we had taken with the project. I was able to hone a lot of my skills of designing an application through this project since I took it upon myself to create the mockups that were used in the final project.</p>
					<p>Further user tests showed that we were making progress, but still had some ways to go. The users that sampled our prototype provided us with more positive feedback than our previous three ideas, but there were still huge flaws for us to consider. It was a little worrisome at the beginning because it made me wonder if we had picked an idea that would work. The 10 Heuristics helped target a lot of the flaws our design had. Using that feedback, I was able to refine details in our initial mockups (top) that helped polish it into the finished product (bottom).</p>

			<h1>Final Product</h1>
			<h4>UW MyClubs</h4>
			<div class="flow-text">
				<p>Our final design was a very streamlined version of our initial concept. It was minimalistic, but not the point where it confused users and it was simplistic. It achieved our goal in what I believe to be a very effective method. It allows for students to browse clubs and events. A feature is implemented to track clubs, but also allows for small user flexibility. I believe that it was the small, refined details that were key to our design.</p>
				<p>A major epiphany that moved the project forward was letting go of the idea of a feature for club officers to communicate. Acknowledge that some good ideas hindered great ideas was not easy to learn, but the lesson was an important one.</p>

			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<h4>A reflection on the 10 weeks</h4>
			<div class="row flow-text">
				<div class=" col s5">
					<p>I learned a great deal more in this class than I would have initially thought. It was surprising how much I was able to learn about the design process in the 10 weeks we had. And I realized I still have a great deal more to learn. Our initial concept seemed pretty easy at the beginning: designing a product that could help the student population facilitate and maintain events with reminders.</p>
					<p>Although many changes were made from our initial conceptions, we were able to create a design that fulfilled our ultimate goal. I feel as though my group functioned very well as a whole. There were small bumps along our journey, but they helped shaped our project and understanding of the design process. Looking back, I may have invested more time in additional user testing because I realized how invaluable feedback from the target population is. It felt tedious to conduct all the tests we did throughout the quarter, but they were instrumentally helpful in shaping the final design. Looking at our final, streamlined design, I felt a sense of overwhelming pride in what our group had accomplished in just 10 weeks.</p>
					<p>The skills I achieved were not only academic, but social. Group work was never something I had looked forward to in high school, but participating in a team of equally eager workers was astronomically fun. I feel as though I have learned a lot as a designer, but accept that I still have innumerable amount of things to learn, which I hope to do so in the future.</p>
